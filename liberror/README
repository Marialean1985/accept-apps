This folder contains the error injection library code.

liberror.cpp drives error injection, selecting which model to use
and passes the user-specified parameter to the model.
A 32-bit 'param' is passed to the error injection driver routine,
'injectInst()'. This parameter is treated as two 16-bit values.
The high order 16-bits specify which error model to use.
The low order 16-bits are passed to the error model as a model
specific parameter.

An error model *must* be implemented using a .hpp/.cpp file pair,
and the error model routines *must* be static functions within a
C++ class.

All headers except the liberrorarch.h and liberrorutil.h headers
can be included normally in the .hpp error model files.
To include the liberror*.h headers, we use an anonymous
namespace within each error model's .cpp file.

e.g.: yourmodel.cpp:

#include "yourmodel.hpp"

namespace {
#include "liberrorarch.h"
#include "liberrorutil.h"
}

// end of yourmodel.cpp

This hack is used to work around the build system and method
used by ACCEPT. Without this hack, linking fails due to multiple
function definitions.
